\description{
Execute a query to find matching entries.
A find query should be composed of at least one `tag='some_tag'` part.
It may also limit the type of entries through the use of `type=?`.
The type may be one of: `blob`, `deque`, `int` (or `integer`), `stream`,
`tag` or `ts`.
Logical operations `and` and `or` as well as negation `not` may be used as
well.

handle <- connect("qdb://127.0.0.1:2836")
